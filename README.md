HEALTH CARE KIT USING EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

Abstract :
          
          Traditional methods of healthcare demands the patient to visit the clinic on a regular basis. These 
conventional methods can be quite cumbersome for both the patient as well as the medical staff. The focus of 
this project is to implement a smart Embedded based health monitoring system with the title of “Health Care 
Kit” which uses noninvasive sensors to read different health parameters and displays it instantly on an LCD 
module. Additionally, the user has the option of calculating his/her BMI which helps them to display their 
obesity characteristics. With this characteristics a patient will change his/her diet and Medication is given 
according to their health status and physical strongness(Obesity). This helps to the doctors to give medication 
according to their physical strongness. 

Components used are:

 1.Aurdino uno 
 2.Keypad
 3.Liquid crystal display
 4.Pulse sensor
 5.Temperature sensor 
 6.Led
 7.Buzzer
